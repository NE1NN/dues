# DUES - Assignment Reminder and Tracker

Dues has been thoughtfully crafted to serve one primary purpose: to provide University of New South Wales (UNSW) students with a comprehensive tool that not only enables them to stay on top of their assignment schedules but also ensures they receive reminders as the submission deadlines for these assignments draw near.

## Functionality
These are the features our team has made so far:
- **Persistence Without Logging In**
  
    Dues offers a seamless user experience by allowing data retention even without the need for users to log in. This feature ensures that students can quickly access their assignment details and deadlines without the hassle of authentication whenever they interact with the app.

- **Persistence with Google Login**
  
    For those who prefer personalized data synchronization across devices, Dues integrates a login option using Google accounts. This facilitates a secure and continuous experience, where students' data is reliably stored and retrieved, enabling them to pick up where they left off on any device.

- **PDF Reader Capability**
  
    Recognizing the prevalence of PDF formats for academic materials, Dues is equipped with a built-in PDF reader. This feature allows students to directly view and interact with their assignment briefs and academic readings within the app itself, streamlining their study process.

- **Course Selection**
  
    Students have the option to customize their experience by selecting the courses they are enrolled in. This tailoring ensures that Dues provides a focused and relevant overview of tasks, aligning with the individual's academic schedule.

- **Deadline Visualization**
  
    Dues presents a clear and intuitive interface for viewing upcoming deadlines. This enables students to easily assess their workload and prioritize tasks, ensuring that they can plan their study time effectively and avoid missing important deadlines.

- **Assessment Completion Tracking**
  
    To help students stay organized, Dues includes a feature to mark assessments as completed. This not only aids in tracking progress but also provides a sense of accomplishment, motivating students to keep up with their coursework.

- **Course Locking Mechanism**
  
    Understanding the need for flexibility, Dues incorporates a 'locking' feature for courses. This allows students to secure or finalize the details of a course once they no longer need to make changes, ensuring that the information remains consistent and is safeguarded against accidental alterations.

## Future Implementation
These are some features we have in mind but have not been implemented yet
- Account for the differences in how they write assessment due dates in the course outline
- Integrate with google calendar (create events for when an assignment is due, give reminders of the event from 1 week, 3 days, 1 day, and 1 hour due)

## How to Run the App
